First of all,
Thank you for your time.

I wanted to put those backend and frontend to docker containers and make it easy to deploy,
but due to some connection problems, I couldn't do it in time.

Please refer each readme.md in each folder.
postgresql setting is as follows.

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:12341234@localhost:5432/pokemon"
```

I didn't have time to implement the auth part,
and also the whole project has a lot of fixes, refactoring to do,
but so far this is what I have.

Thanks, and have a great day!
